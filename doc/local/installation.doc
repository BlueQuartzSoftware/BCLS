\section requirements Software Requirements

%BCLS includes all of its library dependencies, including a
reference <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">CBLAS</a>
implementation.  (We describe below how to link %BCLS against another
CBLAS library.)  It should compile on most Unix-like systems
(including Windows NT/2000/XP using CygWin or MinGW) with no
modification.

At the very least, you will need
- <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU make</a>
- <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>

\section download Downloading BCLS

Dowload the %BCLS source code in your favorite format:
- <a href="downloads/bcls-0.1.zip">bcls-0.1.zip</a>
- <a href="downloads/bcls-0.1.tar.bz">bcls-0.1.tar.gz</a>

Use your browser to download one of these files, or from the
commandline do, for example,
\code
$ curl -O http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mpf/bcls/downloads/bcls-0.1.zip
\endcode

\section compilation Compiling BCLS

If all the prerequisites are installed on your system, then in theory
(see \ref prerequisites below) you should only have to type
\code
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
\endcode
