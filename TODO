-  Matlab MEX
   - Is RHS allocatation for usolve and aprod correct?
   - Allow linear term, bounds, and x0 to be scalars.  Convert to vec's.

-  Preconditioning
   - UMFPACK?
   - Pass current damp param to usolve so that can consider in
     preconditioner.
   - Implement above in Matlab usolve.

-  PRINTN
   - Do the print_level test inside of bcls_print.
     Makes the #define more bearable.

-  Iteration log
   - Incorrect summary with projected linesearch.

-  Exact linesearch
   - Better log output
   - Refine unbounded step detection.

-  Algorithm
   - How to set damp_min for overdetermined systems?
   - Lower bound on OptFac: 1e-6
   - Exit if
     - active set hasn't changed (detect while computing new a-set)
     - step is tiny.

-  Automake/conf
   - Make sure that doc stuff is distributed.

-  C++ safeguard
   - Add mangling safeguard to bclib.h.
